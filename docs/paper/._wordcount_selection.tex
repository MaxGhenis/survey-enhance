This project benefited from discussions and presentations made to other industry stakeholders across government, nonprofit and for-profit sectors. In particular, I presented the methodology and its applications to the HM Treasury internal distributional analysis team, who provided highly useful feedback and shed light on possible future applications. Other organisations and individuals also provided useful feedback and ideas for applications outside the scope of this project: for example, how using higher quality microdata for the random forest model imputations might affect the resultant optimised survey data quality.
